<p align="center"><em>"There is no star brighter than you"</em></p>

Astrocosmos currently is a fun galactic-scale worldbuilding project about space fantasy, while still slightly based on science and convergences of lores from pop cultures. The idea came from a self-made minecraft modpack consist of [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) and [Valkrien Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/valkyrien-skies) mods with its main mod are [Cosmic Horizon](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmic-horizons-cosmos) and [Starlance](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlance), these mods basically add (space)ships those need to be designed culturally for each planet/system. This repository acts as cloud save for my projects and provides files related to Astrocosmos with the intention of being helped with ideas and corrections from the contributors and collaborators. So, clearly, there is no other purpose, usage, or even benefit  of this project, unless for fun and learning Excels, VSCodes, and GitHub. That's the brief explanation to this idea!
